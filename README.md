# Food-Chain-Management-Dashboard

In this project I calculated the difference between the agreed delivery date and actual delivery date using SQL queries. 
By segmenting the data, I identified top customers and products associated with delays. The insights allowed me to recommend strategies such as better inventory planning and revised delivery estimates.
Analyzed key metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) to assess supply
chain efficiency, identifying significant gaps between
performance and targets.
Conducted root cause analysis of delayed deliveries, finding
an average delay of 0.42 days from the agreed delivery date.
Identified top customers (Lotus Mart, Coolblue, Acclaimed
stores) contributing to the highest volume of delayed orders,
leading to further investigation of delivery estimation accuracy
and order volume management.
